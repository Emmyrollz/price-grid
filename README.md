## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I practiced structuring a simple price grid component using HTML and CSS. Below are some code snippets I found valuable:

```html
<h1>Join our community</h1>
<p>30-day, hassle-free money back guarantee.</p>
```

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

This project reinforced the importance of using Flexbox to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

### Continued development

For future projects, I would like to further refine my responsive design skills, especially with grid and flexbox layouts. I also aim to implement more advanced animations and transitions for hover states.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) - This documentation helped me better understand how to structure flexible layouts using Flexbox.
- [CSS-Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide was a helpful reference for implementing the layout in this challenge.
